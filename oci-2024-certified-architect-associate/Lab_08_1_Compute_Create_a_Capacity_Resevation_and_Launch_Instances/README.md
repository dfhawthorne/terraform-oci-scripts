# Lab 8-1: Compute: Create a Capacity Reservation and Launch Instances

## Overview

The capacity reservations allow you to reserve compute capacity in advance and use this capacity when you create instances against the reservation. There is no minimum time or size commitment. You can create, modify, and terminate your capacity reservation at any time.

In this lab, you will:

- Create a Virtual Cloud Network and a subnet
- Create a capacity reservation
- Add a capacity configuration
- Create instances in a capacity reservation
- Move an instance out of a capacity reservation
- Add an instance to a capacity reservation
