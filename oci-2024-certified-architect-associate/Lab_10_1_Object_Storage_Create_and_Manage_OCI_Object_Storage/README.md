# Lab 10-1: Object Storage: Create and Manage OCI Object Storage

## Overview

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Object Storage provides unlimited capacity with high durability and scalability. It is highly reliable and cost efficient. The object storage resources in clude namespace, bucket, and object.

The Object Storage is characterized with strong consistency and security with encryption. By creating unlimited buckets, you can add as many objects as required with a maximum of 10TiB per object. In this lab, you will work on buckets, object versioning, object lifecycle management, replication policy, and retention rule.

In this lab, you will:

- Create an object storage bucket
- Upload an object to a bucket
- Configure a lifecycle policy rule for the bucket
- Create a replication policy for the bucket
- Create a retention rule for the bucket

## Create a Bucket and Upload an Object

## Configure a Lifecycle Policy Rules for the Bucket

## Create a Replication Policy for the Bucket
