# Lab 14-1: File Storage: Create and Mount a File System

## Overview

The oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) File Storage service provides robust and shareable file systems. Network access to your system is provided through a mount target, which is an NFS endpoint that lives in a subnet and connects NFS clients to file systems.

In this lab, you'll learn how to create a file system with the OCI console.

In this lab, you'll:

1. Create a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) and its components
1. Create a VM instance
1. Create a file system
1. Configure VCN Security Rules for file storage
1. Mount the file system from an instance
