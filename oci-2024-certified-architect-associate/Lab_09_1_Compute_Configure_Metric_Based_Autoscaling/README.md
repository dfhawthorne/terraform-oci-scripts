# Lab 9-1: Compute: Configure Metric-Based Autoscaling

## Overview

Autoscaling lets you automatically adjust the number or the lifecycle state of compute instances in an instance pool. This helps you provide consistent performance for your end users during periods of high demand, and reduce your costs during periods of low demand.

In this lab, you will:

- Create a Virtual Cloud Network and a subnet
- Create a load balancer
- Create a compute instance and a custom image
- Create an instance configuration
- Create an instance pool
- Create a metric-based autoscaling configuration
- Test autoscaling
