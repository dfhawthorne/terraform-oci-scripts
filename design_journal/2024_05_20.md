# 2024-05-20: New Repository for OCI Ansible Scripts

A new repository, [ansible-oci-scripts](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/ansible-oci-scripts), has been created to host OCI scripts written in Ansible. This is a parallel repository to [terraform-oci-scripts](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/terraform-oci-scripts).

The main README has been updated to reflect this.
