# 2024-01-03: Successful Provisioning of Compute Instance

I have successfully provisioned a compute instance using the following commands:

```bash
cd from_oci_console
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

The compute instance is created after about 40 seconds.

The source for `main.tf` was created from a stack I generated in the OCI console.
