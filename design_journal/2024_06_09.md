# 2024-06-09: OCI 2024 Certified Network Professional Scripts Moved

I have moved the `oci-2024-certified-networking-professional` directory to the `terraform` directory in the [OCI_CNP](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/OCI_CNP) repository in order to consolidate all scripts for that certification study into one (1) place. (I am using Ansible and OCI CLI scripts as well).

This repository remains so that minor Terraform study can be done without creating a whole new repository.
